Bachelor degree in Economics and student in master's degree in Economics at [Universidad de San Andr√©s](https://udesa.edu.ar/departamento-de-economia). 

My interests in Economics are focused on poverty and similar subjects. This led me to become interested in development and public policies. I believe that from investigating this topics we can make a change on them. I enjoy using econometric tools, especifically in impact evaluations and causality studies.    

I consider myself as a responsible person, always discovering new topics to investigate about.
